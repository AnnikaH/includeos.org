<h2>Set custom location and compiler</h2>
<p>By default the project is installed to /usr/local/includeos.</p>

<p>However, it is recommended to choose a custom location as well as select the compiler we want clang to find.</p>

<p>To do this we can edit ~/.bashrc (in the home folder), adding these lines at the end of the file:</p> 

<pre>
<code class="bash">
    export CC=/usr/bin/clang-3.8
    export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++-3.8
    export INCLUDEOS_PREFIX=<HOME FOLDER>/includeos
    export PATH=$PATH:$INCLUDEOS_PREFIX/bin
   </code>
</pre>

<p>This will also crucially make the boot program visible globally, so that you can simply run boot <myservice> inside any service folder.</p>

<h2>Install libraries</h2>

<p><em>Note:</em> The script will install packages and create a network bridge.</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
    $ git clone https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS
    $ cd IncludeOS
    $ ./install.sh
   </code>
</pre>
